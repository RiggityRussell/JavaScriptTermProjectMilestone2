                He has a book of matches and a pen in one pocket. Alongside a folded up note. Unfolding the note shows that it was written to Vincent from Tyler L Hsu. It reads as follows.<br>\
                'I applaud your business decisions as always Vincent. Our continued prosperity lies in branching out from just railroads. We must encompass all areas where we can make money.'<br>\
                'For this reason I have sent you this new plastic pen. With it we can make untold profits by supplying the masses. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword.'<br>\

                The pen is another plastic pen. As your hands slide around Vincents chest you realize that he has a pistol hidden under his jacket. That is interesting.<br>\
                Why would Vincent be armed with a gun at a dinner with his family? Very strange.<br>\
                Looking at Vincents hands reveal that he did not scratch his attacker. There is nothing under the fingernails and no defensive wounds either.<br>\
                The wound itself is deep. The knife plunged in hard and fast and did the damage it was intended to do.<br>\
                Vincents face reveals little to you. He looks surprised, but that is to be expected when stabbed in the neck. Looking around it doesn't look like theres a ghost anywhere.<br>\
